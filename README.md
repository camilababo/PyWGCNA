# Integrating machine learning and mechanistic modeling towards adaptation of plants to climate change

This repository contains data, analysis notebook and results from my collaborative MSc thesis conducted between the School of Engineering at the University of Minho and the Bioinformatics Group at Wageningen University & Research (WUR). Our research focused on the integration of Machine Learning and mechanistic modelling techniques to predicting gene regulatory interactions associated with Arabidopsis' response to ambient temperature.

During this study, we evaluated three tools: [BIONIC (Biological Network Integration using Convolutions)](https://github.com/bowang-lab/BIONIC), [PyWGCNA (Python-based Weighted Gene Correlation Network Analysis)](https://github.com/mortazavilab/PyWGCNA/), and BADDADAN (currently under development by Ben Noordijk at WUR). Among them, PyWGCNA stands out as a tool for the identification of co-expressed genes from large RNA-seq datasets, offering the ability to infer the relationship between module expression profile and data traits and compare co-expression networks extracted from different WGCNA objects.
