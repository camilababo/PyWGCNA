This directory contains all the extracted modules generated by the PyWGCNA and BADDADAN (in development, by Ben Noordijk, WUR) techniques. These modules are used to facilitate a comparative analysis of the results obtained from each approach and dataset. To facilitate this comparison, the [jaccard_similarity.py](https://github.com/camilababo/PyWGCNA/blob/main/analysis_notebooks/extracted_modules/jaccard_similarity.py) script was developed. Inspired from the the [original PyWCGNA implementation](https://github.com/mortazavilab/PyWGCNA/blob/main/PyWGCNA/comparison.py), this version offers the flexibility to filter out non-overlapping genes for an enhanced assessment.
